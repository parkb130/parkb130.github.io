 <p>
With what stage one starts off with it explaining about reverse racism seems to be affecting marginalized people as a whole. I'm not quite sure myself about reverse racism, but with what I'm guessing it is that its something with discrimination against to racial majority/dominant ethnic groups. And then continues onto mentioning about online abuse relationship-wise to famous social media sites. I think overall with online abuse that it's quite simply impossible to NOT be targetted. With internet trolls growing day by day, it's hard to control every single person on the web when everyday the web itself is expanding second by second.

<p>
Then with the second stage, I feel like overall this is nonsense at this point with it mentioning in the lsat paragraph about "privileged users" and "particularly White users". Like the whole thing itself has so much hypocrisy against each other's race in relation to the web.

<p>
Furthermore, with the reading trying to persuade the correction of the web itself of "fairness", I honeslty think its a waste of time trying to fix social media platforms, blogs, websites, etc. of all sorts when the web is simply a free open space that's quite impossible to be controlled/directed.
