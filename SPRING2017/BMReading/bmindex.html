Starts off the phenomenal, even used now first creation/”innovator” of the drop-down menu that most websites today have. Architect and designer, Bill Atkins created the drop-down menu. After it begins with explaining that the desktop and mouse are the dominant designs for the personal computer. He creates a partnership with Larry Tesler who moved to Apple to work with Bill Atkinson to design the software for Lisa. They both had different purposes and duties to fulfill as in Atkinson had to design prototypes of UI concepts at night while Larry would to UX during day. The earlier softwares way back in the day were mostly designed and created by Atkinson, especially Quickdraw graphics, Hypercard, and many other programs for the Mac. Tesler wanted to go for the concept of just being simply with easy accessing and experiencing of an individual’s relationship to the personal computer. He was responsible for the idea of a single button for the mouse which the feature became Apple’s signature.

Next came Paul Bradley who designed the first Microsoft mouse, molding the essence of the human hand to control the electronic ovular object with perfection and simplicity. Another designer mention in the reading is Bill Verplank, who was behind all the trial and errors of the processing results of the interaction between people and the personal computer. All Verplank did was always answer questions about how he went about with the interaction design and what his process was throughout the innovation era.

Lastly, there was a Human Interface Group that was managed by a man named Cordell Ratzlaff which the HIG was the design of Mac’s software at Apple for five years. He was the head of the team that designed the numerous versions of Mac OS from Mac OS 8 all the way to Mac OS X, which led to the creation of the world-renowned dock layout and making ingenious use of animations.
