READING RESPONSE

 <p>
What a way to start the reading by stating that the criterion for evaluating the results of all design work is by artifact-human interaction, which is still quite a mystery at this point of the reading. Then talks about the feedback loops of computer-human interactions. There has to always or at least most likely be a feedback result when a human interacts with a computer. It is all based on execution of actions that are evaluated through computer's system and data on how it is supposed to handle the input by humans. There has to always be most likely, an endless cycle of a feedback loop.
</p> 

<p>
Branching off of the human-computer interaction, there are TEN different types of systems but the main two would be open and closed-loop systems (After static/dynamic). An open-loop system is when the output signal or condition is neither measured nor fed back for comparison with the input signal or system set point. A closed-loop system is basically the same concept as a open-looped system, but just that there are one or more feedback loops or paths between its output and its input. Which after the TEN types of systems we can progress forward to five distinctions that Stroud Cornock and Ernest Endmonds proposes: static system, dynamic-passive system, dynamic-interactive system, " "(varying), and the matrix. Then comes Kenneth Boulding's systems which consist: Frameworks, Clockworks, Thermostats, Cell, Genetic and Societal, Animal, Human, Social Organism, and the Transcedental.

<p>
After all this comes lastly, the system combinations. First is the Reacting which is action causes reaction. Second is Regulating which is action countering disturbances. Third is Learning which is learning from effecting actions. Fourth is Balancing which is a based on the domino effect of one system input for another. Fifth is Managing and Entertaining which is a two connection based system that rely on each other. Last we have Conversing which is a one linked after another based system with the obvious peer-to-peer conversation/signaling.
