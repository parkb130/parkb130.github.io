Wow! I mean of course, who wouldn't be impressed overall of the presentation. Accessibility is definitely what I would think he was going for, especially for the disability? With everday functions, objects, environment, etc., seems to definitely be a huge problem for an disabled individual. I mean, in my own opinion, with what has been designed and thought for seems to be working at a certain limit. With the senses of mainly feel and smell, there seems to be upcoming problems of design trying to seem simpler BUT not for certain individuals. Definitely the example of the light switch gave me a huge wake up call which is what I said earlier of an everday object. This does all come into play of memorization for certain individuals, but why design something simple when it can hinder them. With what he said about "Deicsions Matter", I feel like this overall creates constant problems for the everyday human being. Design itself leads to a problem one after another. Like what designer Paul Rand quotes, "Design is so simple, that's why it's so complicated.", this leads to my own thoughts kind of going away from Bahram's presentation, but I hate what people perceive designers/artists as. ONE of MANY questions and statements that I've heard/received myself are, "Oh, an artist? Probably not academically strong." "Oh a designer? Hey, can you just design my church's logo for me? Shouldn't be too hard right?". These two just already piss the fuck out of me, especially the church one. Like when I used to go to church, and I was well-known to be a decent designer, my pastor asked me if I could design his church's logo, but of course how could I ask him to pay me? But what more pissed me off and led to me just never going back to church's really was that he said, "Shouldn't be too hard right? It's just art/design, no?" Like what?! Just art/design? I don't think people understand how stressful it is for designers to design something and innovate something never before seen or just create something "simply" unique. Just had the perception against artist/designers. Totally strayed off topic of the reading, but hope it did lead me to my own thoughts so!
